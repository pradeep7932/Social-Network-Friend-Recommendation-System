# Social-Network-Friend-Recommendation-System

This project implements a friend recommendation system based on mutual connections in a social network. It uses graph traversal algorithms like BFS to identify potential friends for a user by analyzing the network's adjacency list representation.
- Dynamic addition of friendships.
- Friend recommendations based on mutual connections.
- Efficient graph traversal using adjacency lists.
- Data Structures: Graphs, Hash Maps, Priority Queues.
